abstract: "go-template is a production-ready starter scaffold for Go libraries that bundles opinionated project structure, module management, and fully automated CI/CD workflows. It integrates GitHub Actions, GoReleaser, comprehensive testing and linting, and security scanning so maintainers can focus on writing code instead of setup and infrastructure."
